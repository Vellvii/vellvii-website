  },
  {
    question: "What is the DDS?",
    answer: "The DDS (Dildo Docking Station) is the conscious evolution of pleasure engineering. It features a tri-layer construction topped with poured acrylic glass — perfectly smooth, crystal-clear, and built for flawless suction. Finally, pleasure has its dedicated, elegant space.",

  {
    question: "What materials is the DOX made of?",

    question: "How does the biometric security work?",
    answer: "One touch. One owner. The Vellvii-branded biometric fingerprint lock ensures your pleasure stays yours — always. It's not just smart — it's personal. No keys, no codes, just your touch and total control.",
  },

    question: "What makes this 'luxury' wellness?",
    answer: "This isn't adult novelty — it's modern intimacy, elevated to art. The DOX is crafted with the same precision and elegance you'd expect from luxury brands like Louis Vuitton or Bentley. It's designed to look, feel, and function like the luxury it is.",
