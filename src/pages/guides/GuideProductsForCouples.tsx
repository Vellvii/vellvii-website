      <h2 className={H2}>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        For couples, the right product is one that respects both people - their comfort, their routines, and the way they share a space. Vellvii is designed for that quiet, considered approach: refined pieces that fit into a shared life rather than disrupt it.
      </p>

      <h2 className={H2}>Start with privacy and comfort</h2>
      <p>
        Privacy comes first. Before considering any specific product, think about how it will be stored, who has access, and how it fits into the rhythm of a shared bedroom. Comfort follows - both people should feel at ease with the piece, its design, and where it lives.
      </p>

      <h2 className={H2}>Choose products that fit your lifestyle</h2>
      <p>
        Lifestyle shapes the right choice. A couple that travels often may prioritize a portable case. A couple building a more grounded home routine may prefer a refined bedroom-focused system. Neither is more correct - they are simply different starting points.{" "}

      </p>

      <h2 className={H2}>Think about storage, not only the product</h2>
      <p>
        Storage is often overlooked, yet it shapes the everyday experience as much as the product itself. A considered storage piece keeps a collection organized, private, and easy to return to its place - which makes the whole routine feel more intentional.
      </p>

      <h2 className={H2}>Why shared organization matters</h2>
      <p>
        For couples, shared organization quietly supports trust and ease. Knowing where each piece lives, that it is private, and that it is cared for removes small frictions from the everyday. Vellvii storage is designed to support that kind of calm, refined order.

        Vellvii DOX is the larger, sturdier bedroom storage and docking hub. For couples, it offers a refined shared home for the Vellvii Pleasure Collection - with shaped inserts that keep compatible pieces organized and in place.{" "}

      <h2 className={H2}>Where Lux fits for personal or travel-friendly storage</h2>
      <p>
        Vellvii Lux is the portable fingerprint-lock storage case. For couples, Lux can sit alongside DOX as a personal or travel-friendly piece - useful for trips, secondary storage, or simply for moments away from home.{" "}

      </p>

      <h2 className={H2}>Choosing your first Vellvii piece</h2>
      <p>
        For couples building toward a wider collection, Vellvii DOX is a natural starting point - a refined bedroom anchor that grows with the Pleasure Collection. From there, individual pieces can be added at your own pace.

      <h2 className={H2}>Final Recommendation</h2>
      <p>
        Start with the storage piece that fits how you actually live - DOX as a refined bedroom anchor, Lux as a portable companion - and let the collection grow from there. For more personal guidance, you can always{" "}
