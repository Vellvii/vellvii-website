      <h2 className={H2}>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Vellvii offers two distinct storage pieces designed for different parts of life. Lux is built for portable, everyday privacy. DOX is built for refined bedroom organization. Both are part of the same design language, but they serve different purposes.

        Vellvii Lux is a portable fingerprint-lock storage case - sized like a refined toiletries-style bag and secured with biometric access. It is designed as a discreet sex toy bag for the moments when privacy needs to travel with you, and is its own self-contained piece - not part of the DOX docking system.{" "}

        Vellvii DOX is the larger biometric sex toy lock box and storage hub. It is the central piece of the Vellvii ecosystem - faux leather exterior, velvet interior with a movable velvet-lined tray, biometric fingerprint lock for fast, private access, and 3 internal USB-A charging ports powered through an external USB-C input. On top, the VDS and DDS act as suction-base mounting stations, turning the DOX itself into a refined stand. DOX is a bedroom-focused storage piece, not a portable one.{" "}

      <h2 className={H2}>Choose Lux if...</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>You want portable, travel-friendly sex toy storage.</li>
        <li>You prefer a fingerprint-locked case that lives in a bag or drawer.</li>
        <li>You are not building around a larger bedroom storage system.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className={H2}>Choose DOX if...</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>You want a refined biometric lock box for the bedroom.</li>
        <li>You are collecting or planning to collect DOX-compatible Vellvii products.</li>
        <li>You want a velvet-lined storage hub with top-mounted VDS and DDS suction stations.</li>

      </p>

      <h2 className={H2}>Can Lux and DOX work together?</h2>
      <p>
        Lux and DOX are independent pieces. Lux does not dock into the DOX system, and DOX is not designed to travel. Many people use both - DOX as a refined bedroom anchor, Lux for everyday portable privacy.
      </p>

      <h2 className={H2}>Final Recommendation</h2>
      <p>
        If you want one piece that travels with you, choose Lux. If you want a biometric lock box and bedroom-focused storage system that grows with the Vellvii Pleasure Collection, choose DOX.{" "}
