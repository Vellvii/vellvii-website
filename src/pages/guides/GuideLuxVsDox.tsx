      <h2 className={H2}>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Vellvii offers two distinct storage pieces designed for different parts of life. Lux is built for portable, everyday privacy. DOX is built for refined bedroom organization. Both are part of the same design language, but they serve different purposes.

        Vellvii Lux is a portable fingerprint-lock storage case. It is designed for the moments when discretion needs to travel with you - in a bag, on a trip, or simply tucked into a drawer. Lux is its own self-contained piece and is not part of the DOX docking system.{" "}

      <p>
        Vellvii DOX is the larger bedroom storage and docking hub. It is the central piece of the Vellvii ecosystem, with shaped inserts that hold compatible Vellvii products in place. DOX is a bedroom-focused storage piece, not a portable one.{" "}

      <h2 className={H2}>Choose Lux if...</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>You want a portable, on-the-move privacy solution.</li>
        <li>You prefer a fingerprint-locked case that lives in a bag or drawer.</li>
        <li>You are not building around a larger bedroom storage system.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className={H2}>Choose DOX if...</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>You want a refined, bedroom-focused storage piece.</li>
        <li>You are collecting or planning to collect DOX-compatible Vellvii products.</li>
        <li>You want shaped docking inserts rather than a single open compartment.</li>
      </ul>

      </p>

      <h2 className={H2}>Can Lux and DOX work together?</h2>
      <p>
        Lux and DOX are independent pieces. Lux does not dock into the DOX system, and DOX is not designed to travel. Many people use both - DOX as a refined bedroom anchor, Lux for everyday portable privacy.
      </p>

      <h2 className={H2}>Final Recommendation</h2>
      <p>
        If you want one piece that travels with you, choose Lux. If you want a bedroom-focused storage system that grows with the Vellvii Pleasure Collection, choose DOX.{" "}
