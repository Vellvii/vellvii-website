      <h2 className={H2}>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Intimate wellness products deserve the same thoughtfulness as the rest of your home. Discreet storage gives them a place that respects privacy, supports organization, and fits seamlessly into the way you actually live.
      </p>

      <h2 className={H2}>Why discreet storage matters</h2>
      <p>
        A considered storage piece keeps personal items private and easy to find. It also supports daily habits - returning each piece to its place, keeping things tidy, and letting your collection feel intentional rather than improvised.{" "}

      </p>

      <h2 className={H2}>Privacy at home and on the move</h2>
      <p>
        Privacy is not only a question of locks. It is about designs that do not announce themselves - pieces that feel at home on a shelf, in a drawer, or inside a travel bag. Vellvii storage is built to look at home in refined interiors and to travel without drawing attention.
      </p>

      <h2 className={H2}>Portable storage vs bedroom storage</h2>
      <p>
        Portable storage suits the everyday - travel, day bags, or simply moving between rooms.{" "}

      </p>
      <p>
        Bedroom storage is built to stay in place - a dedicated, refined home for a growing collection.{" "}
