      <h2 className={H2}>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        A sex toy box is doing more than holding products. It is shaping how a personal collection is stored, accessed, and kept private day to day. The right adult toy box quietly supports privacy, organization, and the small rituals of ownership.
      </p>

      <h2 className={H2}>What to look for in a sex toy storage box</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Privacy by design.</strong> The exterior should not announce what it is. A refined silhouette belongs on a shelf or in a drawer.</li>
        <li><strong>Lockable or biometric access.</strong> A lock keeps personal items personal. A biometric lock box adds privacy without keys or codes.</li>
        <li><strong>Right-sized for your collection.</strong> Too small feels cramped, too large feels excessive. The best size leaves a little room to grow.</li>
        <li><strong>Considered interior organization.</strong> A movable tray or considered lining helps each piece live in its own place.</li>
        <li><strong>Portable or bedroom-focused.</strong> A portable sex toy bag travels with you, a bedroom storage hub stays put.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className={H2}>Privacy and discretion</h2>
      <p>
        Privacy is shaped by silhouette, finish, and access. A refined exterior reads as a considered design object rather than a product container, which is what makes it discreet in everyday spaces.{" "}
        <Link to="/collections/discreet-storage" className="text-primary hover:underline">Explore Discreet Storage</Link>.
      </p>

      <h2 className={H2}>Lockable design</h2>
      <p>
        A lock is the single most important difference between an everyday container and a private storage piece. Biometric access takes this a step further - keeping entry tied to a registered fingerprint, with no keys or codes to keep track of.
      </p>

      <h2 className={H2}>Size and organization</h2>
      <p>
        The right size depends on the collection. A refined interior with a movable tray helps keep smaller items - bullets, accessories, or other personal pieces - separated from larger ones, so the inside of the box stays as considered as the outside.
      </p>

      <h2 className={H2}>Portable sex toy storage vs bedroom sex toy storage</h2>
      <p>
        Portable sex toy storage is a refined sex toy bag designed for travel and personal use.{" "}

      </p>
      <p>
        Bedroom sex toy storage is a more permanent home - a refined biometric lock box that lives beside the bed.{" "}
