      <h2 className={H2}>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Choosing a storage piece is rarely about size alone. It is about how the piece fits your routine - whether it travels with you, stays beside the bed, or quietly anchors a wider collection. Vellvii offers two distinct answers: a portable fingerprint-lock case and a refined bedroom storage hub.
      </p>

      <h2 className={H2}>What is portable storage?</h2>
      <p>
        Portable storage is designed to move. It lives in a bag, a drawer, or a suitcase, and is built around discretion in motion. The priority is privacy on the go - the ability to bring personal items along without drawing attention.
      </p>

      <h2 className={H2}>What is bedroom storage?</h2>
      <p>
        Bedroom storage is designed to stay. It sits beside the bed, on a shelf, or inside a wardrobe, and is built to organize a growing collection in one considered place. The priority is refined, everyday access at home.
      </p>

      <h2 className={H2}>When portable storage makes sense</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>You travel often and want privacy in your luggage.</li>
        <li>You prefer a single, self-contained case rather than a larger system.</li>
        <li>You want a piece that lives in a drawer or bag, not on display.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className={H2}>When bedroom storage makes sense</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>You want a refined home for the Vellvii Pleasure Collection.</li>
        <li>You prefer shaped docking inserts to a single open compartment.</li>
        <li>You want a piece that stays in place, not one that moves with you.</li>

      <h2 className={H2}>How Vellvii Lux fits into portable storage</h2>

      <p>
        Vellvii Lux is a portable fingerprint-lock storage case. It is the piece designed to travel with you - tucked into a day bag, a suitcase, or a bedside drawer. Lux is its own self-contained piece and is not part of the DOX docking system.{" "}

      </p>

      <h2 className={H2}>How Vellvii DOX fits into bedroom storage</h2>
      <figure className="my-6 overflow-hidden rounded-lg border border-white/10">

      </figure>
      <p>
        Vellvii DOX is the larger, sturdier bedroom storage and docking hub. Inside, shaped inserts hold compatible Vellvii pieces in place, giving the collection a refined, dedicated home.{" "}

      </p>

      <h2 className={H2}>Can you use both?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes. Many owners pair both pieces - DOX as a refined bedroom anchor for the wider collection, and Lux as the portable case that travels with everyday routines. The two are independent: Lux does not dock into DOX, and DOX is not built to move.
      </p>

      <h2 className={H2}>Final Recommendation</h2>
      <p>
        If your priority is travel-friendly privacy, choose Lux. If your priority is a refined bedroom-focused storage system, choose DOX. For a side-by-side breakdown, see our{" "}
